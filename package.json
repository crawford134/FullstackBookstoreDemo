  "description": "Uses Mongodb, NodeJs, ExpressJs, and ReactJs  - Backend: MongoDB as a NoSQL database  - Backend: NodeJs for building the APIs - Backend: ExpressJs for helping with both the server side web application and the APIs. Used in combination with the NodeJs and the DB to create a REST API, allowing API requests to be sent from the Frontend  - Backend: Uses the following Libraries:      1. Nodemon is used as a tool to help develop the NodeJs applications by automatically restarting the application anytime there are changes in the directory     2. Mongoose is an object data-modelling model used for both NodeJs and the MongoDB. It manages the relationships between data, provides a schema validation, and it is used to translate between objects in the code and their respective representations in MongoDB   - Frontend: ReactJs is used for building a fast and scalable User Interface (helps render the graphical interface on the screen) - Frontend: Material UI is used for styling the ReactJs Components  - Frontend: Uses the following Libraries:      1. React Router DOM is used to navigate between the pages of our application. It creates some routes and renders different components based on the route/endpoints. It also provides the link components that allow navigation between different routes/endpoints without reloading any pages     2. MaterialUI Icons is ReactJs's predefined component library containing usable predefined components",
